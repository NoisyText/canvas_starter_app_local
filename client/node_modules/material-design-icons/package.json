Instructions for using them are in the [sprites documentation](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/sprites).\n\n## Polymer icons\n\nIf you wish to use the icon set with Polymer, we recommend consuming them via the [`<core-icons>`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-icons) element.\n\n## License\n\nWe have made these icons available for you to incorporate them into your products under the [Creative Common Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your\nproducts.  We'd love attribution in your app's *about* screen, but it's not required. The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell\nthe icons themselves.\n",
